Hey guys,

I just made a master schedule, and it looks like we're all open after class today. I will be making an electronic master schedule today, but just to give everyone an idea for now:

The prime meeting times will be:

Mon:  any time after 1:30
Tue:   any time after 7:30
Wed: any time after 4:30
Thur:  any time after 7:30
Fri:    anytime after 4:30

If you haven't checked it out yet, Jon did something awesome by getting us set up with Google Code: http://code.google.com/p/cop-ginrummy/
Read the email he sent out for more details on that, and please make it known if there are any huge objections. If no one objects before Friday,
I'll just assume that it's what we'll be using.

This is short notice, so if we all don't come to class today, we can meet tomorrow after our lab. Assuming we all go to class today, we'll be at
the same place at 7:20 and should find an empty classroom for a bit. We should begin by getting a quick intro to everyone's documentation,
taking note on the things we like from each so we can form the master solution. This master solution needs to be in the form of a use-case model.

Most groups will probably underestimate the importance of organizing their use-case model BEFORE coding, but by creating it now, we will be making
the coding process take significantly less time, we'll be able to stayed coordinated, we'll be able to assign responsibility for certain tasks, and we'll also
save ourselves from a few sleepless nights right before the lab due date.

Once we decide which modules we'd like to have present in our program and our use-case model is complete (version 1 at least...we'll probably need to
make some changes as we progress), each person needs to pick the module or specific classes they'd like to begin on and thus be responsible for.

As I just explained, we need to have our master use-case model put together before any coding begins. For this reason, the first meeting will take
longer than most, but will get us on our feet and keep us on the ball.

**CURRENT OBJECTIVE:**  complete use-case model before the weekend, let's grind down and get it done
